# ReposiTUI

ReposiTUI (`rt`) is a general purpose version control terminal user interface written in Rust. It aims to be a one-size-fits-all solution for version control UI.

The current focus is on compatibility with [git](https://www.git-scm.com) and [jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) repositories.
